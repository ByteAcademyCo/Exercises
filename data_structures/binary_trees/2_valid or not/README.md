# Valid Tree Or Not a Valid Tree

## Motivation


# Problem Description
Write a Python program to check whether a given a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) or not.
Let a binary search tree (BST) is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:
    2
   / \
  1   3
Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.
Example 2:
    1
   / \
  2   3
Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.
