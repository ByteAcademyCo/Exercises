# Variable Arguments

## Motivation
Variable length argument is a feature that allows a function to receive any number of arguments. There are situations where we want a function to handle variable number of arguments according to requirement (*args) (*Behaves like a list)

## Problem Description
Write a Python function `concat_args` that takes a variable length arguement `*args` which contains string objects and returns the concatination the variables. If `*args` is empty output the empty string.

## Example
```
concat_args("Hello ", "There") == "Hello There"
```
