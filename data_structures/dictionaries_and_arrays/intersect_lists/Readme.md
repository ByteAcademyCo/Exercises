# Intersection of Two Lists 

## Problem Description 
Define a Python function `intersect_lists`, which consumes two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`,
and returns a list containing all the values that appear in both `lst1` and `lst2`. The values may appear in any order in the returned list.

## Examples
```
lst1 = [1, "a", -2, 1.4]
lst2 = ["cat", 0.5, "a", 1, 2]
intersect_lists(lst1, lst2) == ["a", 1]
```
