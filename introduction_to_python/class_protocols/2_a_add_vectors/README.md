# Class Protocols - Vector Class Definition

## Problem Description
Define a python magic method `__add__` in the `Vector3D` class that adds together two vector objects. If we add together two vectors `vec1 = (x1, y1, z1)` and `vec2 = (x2, y2, z2)` the resulting vector will be the sum of the `x` components plus the sum of the `y` components plus the sum of the `z` components.

For Exmaple:
```
vec1 = Vector3D(1, 2, 3)
vec2 = Vector3D(4, 5, 6)
vec1 + vec2 = Vector3D(5, 7, 9)
```
