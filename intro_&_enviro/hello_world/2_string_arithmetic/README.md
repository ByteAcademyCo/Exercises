# String Arithmetic

## Motivation
In the [Arithmetic](https://github.com/ByteAcademyCo/Introduction-To-Python/tree/master/Exercises/Hello-World/1-Arithmetic) exercise we saw the 7 arithmetic operators. Only some of the 7 operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `//`, `%`) work on strings.

## Problem Description
Determine how many of the 7 operators listed above work on the `str` type and store that number in a name `STR_ARITHMETIC`.

Hint: Don't just try arithmetic with strings and strings, try arithmetic with strings and integers as well
