# Max Value

## Motivation
In Python every variable name is a reference. When we pass a variable to a function, a new reference to the object is created. 

## Problem Description
Write a Python function `max_val` that consumes 3 integer values `a`, `b` ,`c`.
The function should output the maximum value of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
