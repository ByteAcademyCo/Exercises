# Unique subsets in a List

# Problem Description
Write a Python class `py_solution` to implement the method `sub_sets`, which takes in a list of integers, `sset`, and returns a list of lists of all unique subsets in `sset`. Hint: You can try using a helper function inside your class definition.

For Example:
```
py_solution.sub_sets([1, 2, 3]) => [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

## Testing
* To test your solution, type 'pytest' within the solution subdirectory

## Submission
* Submit your answers in the *solution.py* file within the *Solutions* subdirectory within this directory
