## Concatenate Data

## Motivation
Concatenation in Python allows us to concatenate a string with another string, but never strings with other data types (such as integers, floats).

## Problem Description
Write a python script that creates 2 string variables `string_1` and `string_2`.
Concatenate the 2 variables and store inside a new variable `result`.
Print the result.
