# Divisible By 3 - Variable Length Arguments

## Motivation
Functions can take in a variable length argument `*args` which can contain any number of arguments passed into a function.

## Problem Description
Write a python function `divisible_by_3` with a variable-length arguement `*args` of integers, and returns a list of all the numbers in `*args` divisible by three.

## Example
```
div_by_3(2, 3, 5, 6, 9) == [3, 6, 9]
```
