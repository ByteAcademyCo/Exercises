# Factorial 

## Motivation
The factorial, symbolized by an exclamation mark (!), is a quantity defined for all integers greater than or equal to 0. For an integer n greater than or equal to 1, the factorial is the product of all integers less than or equal to n but greater than or equal to 1.

## Problem Description
Write a Python function that asks the user for 1 integer value stored in object `n`.
Your goal is to store the factorial of `n` in a new variable, `result`.
Print `result`.
