# Employee Class - Sort Employees

# Problem Description
Define a function `sort_employees` that consumes `employee_lst`, a list of employee objects as defined in the previous question, and returns a list of employee names sorted in alphabetical order.
Hint: `from operator import attrgetter`

## Example
```
emp1 = Employee("John", 1, 45,000, 8)
emp2 = Employee("Jane", 2, 22,000, 1)
emp3 = Employee("Marie", 3, 90,000, 10)

sort_employees([emp1, emp2, emp3]) == ["Jane", "John", "Marie"]
```
