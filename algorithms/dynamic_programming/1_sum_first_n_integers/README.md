# Simple Recursion - Sum of the First n Integers

## Problem Description
In the *solution.py* file, define a recursive function `sum_first_n` that consumes a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of all the positive integers from `1` to `n` inclusive. I.e. `sum_first_n(n) = 1+2+3...+n`.

## Example 
```
sum_first_n(2) => 3
sum_first_n(5) => 15
```
