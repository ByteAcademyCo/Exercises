# Class Protocols - Vector Class Definition

## Problem Description
Define a python function `sort_vectors` that consumes a list of  `Vector3D` objects `vect_lst` and sorts the vectors in increasing order by magnitude. You may use Python's built in sort.

For Exmaple:
```
vec1 = Vector3D(1, 5, 3)
vec2 = Vector3D(4, 4, 1)
vec3 = Vector3D(1, 5, 2)
vec4 = Vector3D(4, 4, 1)

vect_lst = [vec1, vec2, vec3, vec4]
sort_vectors(vect_lst) => [vec3, vec2, vec4, vec1]
```
