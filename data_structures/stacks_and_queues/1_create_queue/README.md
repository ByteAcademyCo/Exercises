# Create Queue

## Motivation
A Queue follows the First-in-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is opened from both the ends hence we can easily add elements to the back and can remove elements from the front. Python provides us with the queue module to work with queue data structure related operations. 

## Problem Description
Write a Python function that contains one queue object `queue_a` having a max size arguement value initialised to 5. 
Put 5 random values to the queue object inside a function "queue" calling it from object `data`
Display the `result` object containing elements of queue.

Hint: Queue elements are not iterable , pick a data type which is iterable.
