#  MVC Details

## Motivation
Model–View–Controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Following the MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for code reuse and parallel development.


## Problem Description
Construct a MVC to capture user name and age and display information while having below conditions:

'model' containing a global list object `data` and function `store` to append name and age values.

'app' containing logic related to the controller where objects `name` , `age` are used to capture values from user view and store the information in model list. Create object `info` which perform call to view and output the name and age. 

'view' containing functions `capture_name`,`capture_age` and `display` to input/output values from/to the user interface.
