# String Case

## Motivation
String values can have a mix of upper case and lower case letters. Python has inbuilt methods to convert from one case to another. 

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that asks the user for a string value residing inside object `string_val`.
Convert the value into upperCase and lowerCase and store the results in variables `upper_data` and `lower_data` respectively. 
Print the results.
