# Range

## Motivation
Python function definition allows the developer to construct a block of code which performs certain functionality. 

## Problem Description
Write a Python function `below_100` that consumes an integer `n`.
If `n` is less than equal to 100 return `"less than 100"`, otherwise return `"greater than 100"`.

## Example
```
below_100(200) == "greater than 100"
below_100(50) == "less than 100"
```
