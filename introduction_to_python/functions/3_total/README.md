# Total

## Motivation
Compound data types have a collection of data. What if I need to return the total sum of my data?

Built-in functions can help, but ***DO NOT USE SUM()*** for this exercise.

## Problem Description
Write a Python function that takes one argument, a list (named `l`), and returns the sum of the list. 

Store the output of the function in a variable `result` and `print` it.
