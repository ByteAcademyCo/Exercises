# String to Upper Case

## Problem Description
Define a Python class named MyString that contains two methods, `set_string` and `upper_string`.
* `set_string` accepts a string from the user and saves it within the class
* `upper_string` returns the string in upper case letters that was input by the user in `set_string` call. The function returns `undefined` if the `set_string` method was not called before this method

## Examples
```
my_str = MyString()
my_str.set_string('hello')
my_str.upper_string() == 'HELLO'
```
