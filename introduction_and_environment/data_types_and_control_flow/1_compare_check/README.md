# Compare Check

## Motivation
Python provides the `==` operator to check if the operands hold the same values, and `!=` for the inverse. 

## Problem Description
Write a python script that contains 2 integers `x` and `y`.
Use the appropriate operator to compare whether `x` and `y` are equivalent, and store that output in a variable named `result`.

Print `result`.
