# Simple Recursion - Factorial

## Problem Description
In the *solution.py* file, define a recursive function `factorial` that consumes a positive integer `n` and returns the factorial of `n`. We define the factorial of `n` as `n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)* ... *1`.

## Example
```
factorial(1) == 1
factorial(2) == 2
factorial(5) == 120
```
