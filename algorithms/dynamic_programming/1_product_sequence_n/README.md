# Simple Recursion - Product of Sequence

## Problem Description
In the *solution.py* file, define a recursive function `product_sequence_n` that consumes a positive integer `n` and returns the product of the mathematical sequence `n*(n-2)*(n-4) ... *(n-x)>0`.

## Example 
```
product_sequence_n(4) => 8
product_sequence_n(5) => 15
```
