# Sum Imaginary Numbers

## Problem Description 
Define a Python function `sum_imaginary`, that consumes a list `ilst` of imaginary numbers represented as tuples of the form `(x,y) = x+yi`, and returns the sum of all the imaginary numbers in `ilst` as a tuple.
Hint: The sum of two imaginary numbers `a+bi + c+di = (a+c)+(b+d)i`.

## Examples
```
ilst = [(1,2), (4,-1), (0, 0), (-2, -2)]
sum_imginary(ilst) == (3,-1)
```
