# Queue Sort 


## Problem Description
Write a Python program that creates a queue object `q` and put random integer values.
Construct logic using functions to sort the elements of the queue in ascending order.

Create one `min` function which returns index of minimum element and `mintorear` function which moves the minimum element to the rear of the queue. 

Finally create a function `sort` which performs recursive operation on the above two functions `min` and `mintorear` to sort the elements and print the output

Dislay the reversed `q`.
