Python provides us with the type() function to capture and check the data type of a value from the user. 
STANDARD DATA TYPES: 1.Integer 2.Float 3.String 4.Boolean 5.Complex Number 

## Problem Description
Write a Python script  that asks the user to input any 2 values.
Store the values in `input_1` and `input_2 ` objects respectively. Check the type of each input and store the results in the variable names `data_1` and `data_2`.
Print the result.
