# update_dictionary 

# Motivation
Dictionaries are Pythonâ€™s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs.

You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value:

## Problem Description 
Define a Python function named `update_dict` that consumes two parameters `key` and `value`. The function returns a new dictionary by appending dictionary element (key-value pair).

## Examples
```
update_dict(1,"Bob") = {1:"Bob"}
```
