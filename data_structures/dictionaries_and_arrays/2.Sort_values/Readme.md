# Sort Values 

# Motivation
Dictionaries in Python are unsorted. They are stored by the hash value of the key, and this allows for fast lookup.

Operator.itemgetter() takes keys of dictionaries and converts them into tuples which is then sorted.The `operator` module has to be imported for its working

## Problem Description 
Write a python program to sort the dictionary values in ascending and descending order.Create a dictionary with integer values stored in variable `my_dict`, perform the inbuilt function `operator.itemgetter()` to sort the values.Store the result in object `result`,print `result`.
