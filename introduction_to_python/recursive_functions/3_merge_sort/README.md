# Merge Sort

## Problem Description
Define a recursive Python function named `custom_sort` that consumes one argument `num_list`, a list of numbers. The function returns a new list containg the same numbers but in sorted order. Hint: Using the [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm is the most efficient way to solve this question.

* For example
```
custom_sort([1,6,3,9,0]) == [0,1,3,6,9]
```
