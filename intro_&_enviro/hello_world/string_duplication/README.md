# String Duplicate

## Motivation
String values can be duplicated with help of the `*` operator.

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that asks the user for a string value and an integer value, representing the number of times the user wishs to duplicate the string.
Store the values as `string_1` and `dup_val `, respectively. Then, repeat the string `dup_val` number of times and store the result with the variable name `data`.
Print `data`.
