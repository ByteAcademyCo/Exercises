# Squares Dictionary 

# Motivation
Dictionaries are Pythonâ€™s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs.

You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value:

## Problem Description 
Define a python function `squares_dict`, that consumes a positive integer, `n`, and returns a dictionary where the key-value pairs are of the form `x: x*x`, for all `x` between `1` to `n`.

## Examples
```
squares_dict(4) == {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
```
