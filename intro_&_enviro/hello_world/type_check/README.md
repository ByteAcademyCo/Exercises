# Type Check

## Motivation
Python provides us with the type() method to check the data type of a variable. 

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that asks the user to input any 2 values, and store the values in two variables, `input_1` and `input_2 `.
Check the type or each, and store the results in two new variables, `result_1` and `result_2`.
Print both results.
