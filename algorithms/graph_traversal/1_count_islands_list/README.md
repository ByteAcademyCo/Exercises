# Count the Islands - Adjacency List Representation

## Motivation
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. 
There are two common ways to represent a graph in python:

1. Adjacency Matrix Representation:
    Let n be the number of node in our graph.
    We can create an n by n matrix `M`, where `M[i][j] = 1` if there exists an edge from node `i` to node `j`. If there does not exist an edge from node `i` to node `j`, `M[i][j] = 0`

2. Adjacency List Representation:
    We can use a dictionary to represent a graph, where each key in the dictionary represents a node, and the values for each node `i` will be a list of all the nodes `j` where there exists an edge from node `i` to node `j`.
    
## Problem Description
An island is a node with zero incoming or outgoing edges.
In the *solution.py* file, define a function `count_islands` that consumes an adjacency list and returns the total
number of islands in the graph defined by the given adjacency list.

## Example
```
adjacency_list = {
    0: [1,3,5],
    1: [0,1,3,6],
    2: [],
    3: [0,3],
    4: [],
    5: [6],
    6: [3,5]
}
count_islands(adjacency_List) => 2
```
