# Stack Pop 

## Motivation
Python Lists are one way to implement stack operations. Include-: 

1.Adding - It adds the elements in the stack and increases the stack size. The addition takes place at the top of the stack.
2.Deletion - It consists of two conditions, first, if no element is present in the stack, then underflow occurs in the stack, and second, if a stack contains some elements, then the topmost element gets removed. It reduces the stack size.
3.Traversing - It involves visiting each element of the stack.

## Problem Description
Write a Python program to create a stack object `stack_fruits` containing elements 'apple','banana','orange','watermelon','grapes'.
Build logic to perform the pop operation on the object.
Display `result` of the remaining elements of the stack.
