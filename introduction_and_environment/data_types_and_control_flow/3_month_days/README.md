# Month Days

## Motivation
Each month contains different number of overall days. From the month name , I can easily tell the number of overall days. 

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that asks the user for an wtring value associated with any month of the calendar year.
Store it in an object `month`.

Your goal is to check whether the `month` exists in an alredy defined dictionary variable `month_dict` contais key:value pairs of MonthName:TotalMonthDaysInTheMonth format. 

If `month` exists- retrieve the TotalMothDayInTheMonth value from the dictionary w.r.t `month` and store the value in variable `data`
Print the result
