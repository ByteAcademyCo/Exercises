# Queue Front 

## Motivation
To implement a queue, we need two simple operations:

enqueue - It adds an element to the end of the queue.
dequeue - It removes the element from the beginning of the queue.

Operations on Queue

1.Addition - It adds the element in a queue and takes place at the rear end, i.e., at the back of the queue.
2.Deletion - It consists of two conditions - If no element is present in the queue, Underflow occurs in the queue, or if a stack contains some elements then element present at the front gets deleted.
3.Traversing - It involves to visit each element of the queue.

## Problem Description
Write a Python function that contains one object `result` which performs a function call "queue"
Initialize  a `queue_a` queue object having a max size 5. 
Put 5 integer values to the object.
Display the `result` of the front element from `queue_a`.
