# Variable Arguments

## Motivation
Variable length argument is a feature that allows a function to receive any number of arguments. There are situations where we want a function to handle variable number of arguments using (*args) (*Represented as a tuple)

## Problem Description
Write a Python function that takes an variable length argument and return  data. 
Your goal is to create an object `result` which performs the function call by passing a series of string values, and then concatenating them all into one single string.
Print the output.
