# Arithmetic

## Problem Description
The *solution.py* file contains 2 variables `x` and `y` whose contents are hidden from you (the default values of 0 are placeholders). Below is a table of 7 variables you must create and the associated values they should be bound to.

  Variable  | Value
:----------:|:-----:
`SUM`       | `x + y`
`DIFF`      | `x - y`
`MULT`      | `x * y`
`DIV`       | `x / y`
`POWER`     | `x ** y`
`QUOTIENT`  | `x // y`
`REMAINDER` | `x % y`
