# Stack Push 

## Motivation
A Stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) principle.
To implement a stack, we need two simple operations:

push - It adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop - It removes an element from the top of the stack.


## Problem Description
Write a Python program to create a stack object 'stack_a' containing elements 'C','Perl,'C++','Java'.
Peform a push operation adding a new element 'Python' to the top of the stack. 
Display the `result`.
