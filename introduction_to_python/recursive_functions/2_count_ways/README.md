# Count ways

## Problem Description
Assume you are climbing a stair case and it takes `n` steps to reach to the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
Write a recursive Python function named `count_ways` that consumes a number `steps`. The function returns the number of distinct ways to climb to the top. Hint: Make sure you attempt the question before trying this one!

* For Example
```
countways(4) == 5 # (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (2, 2)
```
