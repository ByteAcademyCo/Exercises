# Stack Null Check 

## Motivation
Data structure organizes the storage in computers so that we can easily access and change data. Stacks and Queues are the earliest data structure defined in computer science.

In stacks, elements are stored one over another, and these elements get removed in the reverse order of the arrival i.e. LIFO concept is followed. LIFO means Last in First out.

A stack is implemented using Linked Lists

## Problem Description

Check if the object is empty.
If empty diplay `True` else display `False`.
