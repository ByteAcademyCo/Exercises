# Election Winner

## Problem Description 
You are holding an election. Define a Python function named `election_winner` that consumes a non-empty list of candidate names as strings `clst`, where each name in the list represents a vote for that candidate. Return the name of the candidate who wins the election. If there is a tie, output the name of the candidate which comes first in lexicographical order.

## Examples
```
clst = ["Trump", "Bernie", "Bernie", "Oprah", "Biden", "Bernie", "Trump"]
election_winner(clst) == "Bernie"
```
