# Command Basics

## Problem Description
The list below contains a number of variable names, as well as a text description of many different **bash** commands. Assign the name of the correct **bash** command, as a lowercase Python string, to each corresponding variable.  

Unnecessary spaces will result in failed tests, make sure not to leave trailing spaces in the solutions!

For example:  
Variable: `ONE`  
Description: command used when you remember the name of a **bash** command, but forget what it does

In *solution.py* you would write:
```python
ONE = 'man'
```

Variable: `TWO`  
Description: View the contents of a directory

Variable: `THREE`  
Description: Create a new directory (ignore any necessary arguments or options)

Variable: `FOUR`  
Description: Create an empty file

Variable: `FIVE`  
Description: Create a copy of a file, or with an option, copy the contents of a directory

Variable: `SIX`  
Description: Change the name of a file or directory

Variable: `SEVEN`  
Description: Delete a file, or with an additional option, a directory
