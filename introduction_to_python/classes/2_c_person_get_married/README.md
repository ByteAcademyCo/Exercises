# Person Class Method - Get Married

# Problem Description
Using your `Person` class and `Child` class you defined in a previous question, define a method, `get_married`, that consumes `self` and `other` and sets the spouse of both person objects to be the other person.

 ## Example
 ```
 Anton = Person("Anton", 29, None, [])
 Nell = Person("Nell", 26, None, [])
 Anton.get_married(Nell) == None
 Anton.spouse == Nell
 Nell.spouse == Anton
 ```
