# Bitwise Operators 2

## Motivation


## Problem Description 
Given two binary values x and y, compute the following bitwise operations on that 

1.Bitwise XOR (^)
2.Bitwise right shift (>>)
3.Bitwise left Shift (<<)

Return the solutions in objects `Answer_Xor`,`Answer_right_shift` and `Answer_left_shift` respectively and print the same.
