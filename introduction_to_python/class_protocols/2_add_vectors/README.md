# Class Protocols - Vector Class Definition

## Problem Description
Define a python magic method `__add__` in the `Vector3D` class that adds together two vector objects. If we add together two vectors `vec1` and `vec2` the resulting vector will be `(vec1.x + vec2.x, vec1.y + vec2.y, vec1.z + vec2.z)`.

For Exmaple:
```
vec1 = Vector3D(1, 2, 3)
vec2 = Vector3D(4, 5, 6)
vec1 + vec2 = Vector3D(5, 7, 9)
```
