# Class Protocols - Vector Class Definition

## Problem Description
Define a python magic method `__str__` in the `Vector3D` class that can be used by python's built in `print` method to nicely print out a vector object. When printing a vector you should print out `(x = X, y = Y, z = Z`), where `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are the values in the given vector object.

For Example:
```
print(Vector3D(3, 4, 2)) prints out "(x = 3, y = 4, z = 2)"
```
