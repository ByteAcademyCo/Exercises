# Command Basics 2

## Problem Description
The list below contains a number of variable names, as well as a text description of many different **bash** commands. Assign the name of the correct **bash** command, as a lowercase Python string, to each corresponding variable. These are harder than the first few, as they may contain additional arguments to be included with the command name.  

Unnecessary spaces will result in failed tests, make sure not to leave trailing spaces in the solutions!

For example:  
Variable: `ONE`  
Description: Command used when you remember the name of a **bash** command named "test", but forget what it does

In *solution.py* you would write:
```python
EXAMPLE = 'man test'
```

Variable: `ONE`  
Description: Navigate from the current directory to a new directory, named "exercises"  

Variable: `TWO`  
Description: View our shell's current directory location  

Variable: `THREE`  
Description: View the *entire* contents of a file named "textfile.txt" in our terminal  

Variable: `FOUR`  
Description: View *only* the last 10 lines of a file named "textfile.txt"  

Variable: `FIVE`  
Description: View the contents of the current directory, including hidden files  

Variable: `SIX`  
Description: View *only* the first 10 lines of a file named "textfile.txt"  

Variable: `SEVEN`  
Description: Create a copy of a file, named "stackdata.json" with the name "stockdata.json
