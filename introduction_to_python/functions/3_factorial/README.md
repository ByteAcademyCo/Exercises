# Factorial 

## Motivation
The factorial, symbolized by an exclamation mark (!), is a quantity defined for all integers greater than or equal to 0. For an integer n greater than or equal to 1, the factorial is the product of all integers less than or equal to n but greater than or equal to 1. The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

## Problem Description
