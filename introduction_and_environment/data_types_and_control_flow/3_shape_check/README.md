# Shape Check 

## Motivation
 3-Triangle , 4-Quadrilateral , 5-Pentagon , 6-Hexagon, 7-Heptagon, 8-Octagon, 9-Nonagon are just few shapes in geometry ranging 3-9.

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that asks the user for 7 integer inputs using a for loop, store all values in a list called g_int. (Note: do not pass any arguments [message] in the input function). Then Create a list variable called g_lst, and for each valid geometric shape number the user enters in the range [3-9], append the corresponding shape name string to g_lst. If the user enters an invalid geometric shape number outside the range [3-9], break out of the loop. Note: The first letter of each shape name should be capitalized. You may find it useful to create a dictionary mapping numbers as keys, to their corresponding shape string.
