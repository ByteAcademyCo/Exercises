## Motivation
The **filter()** method filters the given sequence with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not. A **lambda** function is a single-line function declared with no name, which can have any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression

## Problem Description
Write a python function that accepts an arbitrary number of positional arguments to find numbers divisible by thirteen from a list, using a lambda function.

Your goal is to create a variable `result` will performs function call by passing a series of integer values. 

Use an anonymous function to filter and compare if divisible or not.

Print the result.
